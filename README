MooTools Plugins and Enhancements Repository

### TO DO

* Tests don't work - need to figure out how to manage mootools-core dependency
* PostEditor needs docs, unit test
* Date needs general clean up; it works well, but needs to be organized
* Localization needs to be flushed out more clearly with a well thought out scheme.
