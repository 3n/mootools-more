MooTools Plugins and Enhancements Repository

### TO DO

* Need to add tests for all libs
* Discuss how to handle ToElement and Drag :)
* Make the Date Specs pass in all browsers but Firefox
* Decide if reworking the whole source of all plugins makes you an author ( :P )

### StyleGuide

* See mootools-core and apply that same coding style to mootools-more :)

### Breaking Changes

* Option offsets in Tips renamed to offset

### Breaking Changes regarding Clientcide

* IframeShim works a little different now
* Removing dbug when not in that Request.JSONP thingy
